        <h4>Reprogramming by forced expression of the Yamaka factors</h4>
	    	<section>
	    	<p><strong>Main source</strong> - <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31664-6">article</a> in <i>Cell</i> "In Vivo Amelioration of Age-Associated Hallmarks by Partial Reprogramming".
	    		Report about the reserach in The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/science/scientists-say-they-can-reset-clock-of-aging-for-mice-at-least.html?_r=4">article</a> and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/12/15/molecules-reverse-aging/">another one</a>. research says that partial reprogramming by short-term cyclic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) ameliorates cellular and physiological hallmarks of aging and prolongs lifespan in a mouse model of premature aging. Similarly, expression of OSKM in vivo improves recovery from metabolic disease and muscle injury in older wild-type mice.</p>

    	<h4>Calorie restriction</h4>
	    	<section>
	    	<p>Calorie restriction is a proven way to delay aging in many species. Yet unproven in humans.

    	<h4>Anti-diabetic drug Metformin</h4>
	    	<section>
		    	<p>Metformin found to extend lifespan of diabetics according to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11019987/10-pence-a-day-drug-could-help-millions-live-longer.html">Telegraph artcile</a>. Raw data found survival levels were almost identical in the those with diabetes who were given metformin, and among the “control” group, without the condition. But when the data was adjusted to account for other factors - such as higher obesity levels among the group with diabetes – those given metformin had survival rates 15 per cent higher.</p>
		    	<p>
	    		 <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31667-1">Research</a> that shows that metformin kills cancer cell and extends lifespan via the same ancient metformin response pathway which is conserved from worms to humans. Biguanide-induced inactivation of mTORC1 subsequently inhibits growth through transcriptional induction of ACAD10.
