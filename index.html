        <h4>Reprogramming by forced expression of the Yamaka factors</h4>
	    	<section>
	    	<p><strong>Main source</strong> - <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31664-6">article</a> in <i>Cell</i> "In Vivo Amelioration of Age-Associated Hallmarks by Partial Reprogramming".
	    		Report about the research in The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/science/scientists-say-they-can-reset-clock-of-aging-for-mice-at-least.html?_r=4">article</a> and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/12/15/molecules-reverse-aging/">another one</a>. Research says that partial reprogramming by short-term cyclic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) ameliorates cellular and physiological hallmarks of aging and prolongs lifespan in a mouse model of premature aging. Similarly, expression of OSKM in vivo improves recovery from metabolic disease and muscle injury in older wild-type mice.</p>

    	<h4>Calorie restriction</h4>
	    	<section>
	    	<p>Calorie restriction is a proven way to delay aging in many species. Yet unproven in humans.
	    		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction">Wiki</a> about calorie restriction.
	    		<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4557">Studies</a> on monkeys, where CR delayed disease onset and mortality in rhesus monkeys on a long-term ~30% restricted diet since young adulthood.</p>
	    		<p>Another <a href='http://news.wisc.edu/calorie-restriction-lets-monkeys-live-long-and-prosper/'>study on rhesus monkeys</a> shows that eating less is beneficial in adult and older primates but is not beneficial for younger animals.Even small differences in food intake in primates could meaningfully affect aging and health. At nonrestricted levels of food intake, what is eaten can make a big difference for fat mass and body composition. CR shows significant benefits in survival and reductions in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance for monkeys that ate less than their peers</p>

    	<h4>Anti-diabetic drug Metformin</h4>
	    	<section>
		    	<p>Metformin found to extend lifespan of diabetics according to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11019987/10-pence-a-day-drug-could-help-millions-live-longer.html">Telegraph artcile</a>. Raw data found survival levels were almost identical in the those with diabetes who were given metformin, and among the “control” group, without the condition. But when the data was adjusted to account for other factors - such as higher obesity levels among the group with diabetes – those given metformin had survival rates 15 per cent higher.</p>
		    	<p>
	    		 <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31667-1">Research</a> that shows that metformin kills cancer cell and extends lifespan via the same ancient metformin response pathway which is conserved from worms to humans. Biguanide-induced inactivation of mTORC1 subsequently inhibits growth through transcriptional induction of ACAD10.

    		<h4>Telomere lenghtening</h4>
    		<section>
    			<p>Telomeres are the caps at the end of each strand of DNA that protect our chromosomes. Telomere shortening in humans can induce replicative senescence, which blocks cell division. This mechanism appears to prevent genomic instability and development of cancer in human aged cells by limiting the number of cell divisions. However, shortened telomeres impair immune function that might also increase cancer susceptibility. If telomeres become too short, they have the potential to unfold from their presumed closed structure. The cell may detect this uncapping as DNA damage and then either stop growing, enter cellular old age (senescence), or begin programmed cell self-destruction (apoptosis) depending on the cell's genetic background (p53 status). Uncapped telomeres also result in chromosomal fusions. Since this damage cannot be repaired in normal somatic cells, the cell may even go into apoptosis. Many aging-related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres. Organs deteriorate as more and more of their cells die off or enter cellular senescence.</p>
    			<p>It is also assumed that too long telomeres cause cancer. Which is why the strategy of regenerating telomeres as a way to slow down aging seems doubtful. However this <a href="http://joshmitteldorf.scienceblog.com/2016/12/12/telomeres-too-much-of-a-good-thing/">artcile</a> agrues that assumption that extra-long telemeres lead to cancer maybe not true and became a common knowledge with a little proof behind it. Among the proofs that there are health benefits from extra-long telomeres it cistes this <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11739">article on chimaeric mice</a> which had cells with normal and extra-long telomeres. Study showed that chimaeric mice with hyper-long telomeres accumulate fewer cells with short telomeres and less DNA damage with age, and express lower levels of p53. Wound-healing rates in the skin are increased in chimaeric mice. There was no increased incidence of spontaneous tumours in the chimaeric mice with hyper-long telomeres.</p>
